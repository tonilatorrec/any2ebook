# any2ebook

Converts links (stored individually in .md files like [Obsidian clippings](https://obsidian.md/clipper) or as a list of links in a text file) to epub files that can be read with ebook readers.
Websites are converted to readable text using the [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) tool through the [ReadabiliPy](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ReadabiliPy) Python wrapper.

## Setup
Install using `uv` as a tool:
```
uv tool install git+https://github.com/tonilatorrec/any2ebook.git
```

Or with `make`, this also creates the cli and gui executables:
```
make install
make build
```

## Inputs 
These two inputs are supported:
1. (Default) Any `.md` file with a YAML front matter that has at least the `source` property will work. The files generated by the Obsidian Web Clipper have it by default. Example:
```yaml
---
source: "LINK_TO_ARTICLE"
# other properties 
---
# file content
```
Run: 
```
any2ebook
```

In this case, the program may ask for:
- **Clippings path**: path to the top level folder containing the `.md` files. For the Obsidian web clipper this can be the path to the vault where links are clipped.
- **Output path**: path where epub files are stored.

2. Any file containing a list of links, each link in a new line also works. Example
```text 
# links.txt
"LINK_TO_ARTICLE_1"
"LINK_TO_ARTICLE_2"
...
"LINK_TO_ARTICLE_N"
```
Run: 
```
any2ebook -f links.txt
```

In this case only the output path is required, and invalid lines are skipped.

Each URL is attempted once. If the conversion fails it will be recorded and skipped in future runs.
