The first time the program runs, it will ask for the following paths:
- **Clippings path**: the path to the parent folder where each Obsidian clipping is stored as an .md file. This folder can be set for each template in the Obsidian Web Clipper extension options.
- **Output path**: the path to the folder where the epub files will be stored.
